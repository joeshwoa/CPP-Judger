  "inputFormat": "The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains 2n integers a₁,a₂,…,a₂ₙ (0≤aᵢ≤100) — the numbers in the set.",
  "outputFormat": "For each test case, print \"Yes\" if it can be split into exactly n pairs so that the sum of the two elements in each pair is odd, and \"No\" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.",
  "notes": "In the first test case, a possible way of splitting the set is (2,3), (4,5).\n\nIn the second, third and fifth test case, we can prove that there isn't any possible way.\n\nIn the fourth test case, a possible way of splitting the set is (2,3)."
