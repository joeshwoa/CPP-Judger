  "inputFormat": "The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤162) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of each test case consists of three integers a, b, c (1≤a,b≤9, −8≤c≤18). The additional constraint on the input: it will be generated so that exactly one of the two equations will be true.",
